					<h4>Servo motor controller error handler</h4>
						<p>Using a PIC18F Microchip processor, this system was designed to detect errors for a Litho-Flexo label
							 printing machine and to stop the machine if the appropriate switches are toggled on error. Errors handled
							 include missing material, using a photo eye, over-tension, and jam detection.</p>
						<p>The main challenge in developing on this chipset was the issue of configuration. This was my first
							large project, and the PIC18F was the largest microprocessor I had dealt with. However, with the usage of 
							documentation and some outside help, I was able to stop the machine when necessary.</p>

					<h4>Bow and Arrow game</h4>
						<p>An embedded systems project utilizing the ATMega1284 microprocessor. Two players take turns 
							shooting arrows at each other using a potentiometer and button, displayed on a LCD screen, 
							the inputs read through USART. The report with more information can be found here. </p>

					<h4>Self-made hidden-desk</h4>
						<p>A hardware woodworking project that combines the functionality of a bed and desk into a 
							space saving design, based upon the idea of a similar product found here. This was the first time I was making 
							a wood object not for myself, and really drove home the concept of quality control. I made 3 during 
							construction, using 12 piceces of 4'x8'x3/4" plywood, and am now living with one.</p>
